In my first foray into running a Bitcoin node, I did what most beginners do: I followed one of the many excellent guides written by enthusiasts. Since I already had Raspberry Pi hardware, I used the wonderful [Raspibolt](https://raspibolt.org) guide. I can't speak highly enough of the content or the community that has maintained it over the years. I learned so much - not just about Bitcoin, but also about Linux, security, and privacy - thanks to this resource. <!--more-->

However, things took a turn when I upgraded my node to Bitcoin Core v29.0. After weeks of troubleshooting, my little Pi just wouldn't complete the sync. Despite many attempts, it never reached 100% again. All good things must come to an end, so I decommissioned my node, repurposed my Pi, and began searching for new hardware to host a more robust Bitcoin node.

### Why a Micro PC?

I needed something more powerful - but not too powerful. Enter: micro PCs.

Compared to a Raspberry Pi, these mini desktops offer some real advantages:

- **Availability:** There's a constant supply of used corporate mini PCs on the second-hand market thanks to regular hardware refresh cycles and business liquidations.
- **Affordability:** They’re often priced similarly to a fully-kitted Raspberry Pi setup.
- **Build quality:** Designed for business environments, they’re durable, quiet, and energy-efficient.
- **Upgradability:** They support far more RAM and storage than a Pi and are easy to service.
- **Versatility:** Beyond running a Bitcoin node, these machines can perform other lightweight server tasks.

### Hardware and Upgrades

I found a **Dell Optiplex 7070 Micro** with a **9th-gen Intel i5 processor** for just **€200**. For comparison, refurbished models with similar specs were selling for around **€300**.

Here’s what I upgraded:

| Component      | Original        | Upgraded To       |
|----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| RAM            | 2×8GB (16GB)     | 2x16GB Samsung DDR4 SODIMM (M471A2K43CB1-CTD)         |
| Storage        | Samsung 256GB M.2 2230 NVMe PCIe Gen3 x4 SSD        | Crucial P3 2TB M.2 2280 NVMe PCIe Gen3 x4 SSD         |

Although the system can support 64GB of RAM, I didn’t need that much for a Bitcoin node. I spent around **€200 on upgrades**, but plan to sell the original SSD and RAM to recover some of the cost.

### Setting Up the Node

I didn’t want to stray too far from what I knew, so I started by installing **Debian 12** on the Optiplex. I followed much of the Raspibolt guide again, applying similar security and privacy hardening practices. Installing **Bitcoin Core** and **Electrs** on Debian was almost identical to the process on Raspberry Pi OS.

The blockchain sync took just a couple of days - a huge improvement over the week-long syncs I was used to on the Pi. I still don’t fully understand what went wrong with my Pi setup. It remains a great device for running a node. But if you have the space and budget, I highly recommend using a micro PC. The extra computing power not only improves sync time but also adds some future-proofing in case your Pi starts struggling, like mine did.

### Beyond Bitcoin

One of the biggest advantages of moving to a micro PC is the headroom it provides. Running a Bitcoin node doesn’t tax the system much, so the machine can comfortably handle additional tasks.
