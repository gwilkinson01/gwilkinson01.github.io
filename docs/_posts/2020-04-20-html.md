As organizations continue to strengthen their security posture, understanding and managing their external attack surface has become increasingly important. Microsoft Defender External Attack Surface Management (MDEASM) helps identify, monitor, and manage vulnerabilities across all externally facing assets, providing vital insights into potential security threats.

Incorporating Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices, you can automate the deployment of MDEASM into your Azure environment using Azure DevOps pipelines. Whether you're working with ARM templates or Terraform, you can streamline and scale your deployments while maintaining consistency and compliance.

In this post, we'll walk through how to deploy Microsoft Defender External Attack Surface Management (MDEASM) via Azure DevOps using two popular IaC approaches:

1. ARM Templates, which leverage Azure's native JSON-based infrastructure definitions.
2. Terraform, an open-source, multi-cloud IaC tool that offers more flexibility and provider support.

By the end of this guide, you'll be able to automate the deployment of MDEASM in a secure and efficient manner, allowing your team to focus on monitoring and defending your external attack surface.
