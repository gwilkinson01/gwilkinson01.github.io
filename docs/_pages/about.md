👋 Hi, I’m Greg

👀 I’m interested in threat & vulnerability management, threat intelligence, software, data, cloud & security engineering, open source, electrical engineering, history, geopolitics, anthropology, and Bitcoin.

🌱 I’m currently learning malware reverse engineering, c/c++, circuit design, and microcontroller programming.

💻 If you're interested, check out my projects and contributions on [Github](https://github.com/gwilkinson01).

⚡️ Enjoying my blog? Buy me a coffee… in sats! Just tip me via my Lightning address: magentajail01@walletofsatoshi.com
